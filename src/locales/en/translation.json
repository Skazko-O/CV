    "text": "After receiving a degree in computer systems and networks from NTUU KPI, I began working as a programmer at the Main Computing Centre of Ukrzaliznytsia. I worked with Oracle PL/SQL databases. Later, I worked as a system administrator at a company with a chain of clothing and children's goods stores. In 2008, I was a manager working with key clients of retail store chains. In 2009, my friend and I founded an online store for game consoles and console games. Having gained experience in my own business, I consulted and developed other online stores. In 2025, I received a second degree as a front-end developer. I mastered HTML5, CSS, JS, and React.JS. I am developing in this direction, learning new technologies, working on the implementation of my own ideas, and considering offers for the position of front-end developer."
